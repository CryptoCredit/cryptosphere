The Cryptosphere is a global peer-to-peer cryptosystem for publishing and
securely distributing content anonymously with no central point of failure.
The system is openly federated and anyone can join. To ensure quality service
and prevent abuse, the Cryptosphere uses an integrated cryptographically
secure reputation system which provides a distributed web of trust.

There are several systems with similar goals to the Cryptosphere, such as
MNet, Freenet, and Tahoe-LAFS. These systems serve as inspiration for the
Cryptosphere's design. The Cryptosphere is also heavily influenced by Git, the
distributed version control system.

### Is it any good?

[Yes.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

### Is It "Production Readyâ„¢"?

No, the Cryptosphere is still in an early development stage, and is not yet
ready for general usage.

Use Cases
---------

The Cryptosphere provides an encrypted storage system where only users with
the capability tokens for respective content are able to access it. Unlike
many other peer to systems, there is no global search system because all
content in the system is encrypted and therefore unsearchable.

This makes the Cryptosphere quite a bit different from many other P2P systems
which sought to publicize users content. Instead, the Cryptosphere tries to
keep your content as confidential as possible. This makes it useful for the
following things:

* Secure personal backups
* File sharing among small groups (ala Dropbox)
* Secure anonymous encrypted source control
* Censorship-proof anonymous web hosting
